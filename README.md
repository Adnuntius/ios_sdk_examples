# iOS Examples

Examples for ios sdk

## Building

Use Carthage to build the AdnuntiusSDK.framework and import into your project.  Run carthage update from the example 
directory to update the version of AdnuntiusSDK.framework.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Ad from API

This is an example of using the SDK via json api

This functionality is likely to be removed from the SDK as we focus on uiwebview support on both iOS and Android

### Example 3 - Ad from Script

Directly embedding the adn.js into a web view sample
